# MLB-Position-Players-Offensive-Ratings
In the modern age of baseball, analytics play a vital role in the MLB. Analytics shape MLB teams' rosters and game plans. I used a balanced approach when analyzing players, such as using average and strikeout percentage, which are two statistics that are not commonly used in the modern age of baseball. I also included statistics that are very popular in the twenty-first century, such as home runs and OPS (On-base Plus Slugging). I used other statistics to grade MLB hitters like Hard% (when exit velocity is 95+), OBP, RBIs, SB, and SB%. I applied multipliers based on my interpretation of the data and my personal experience playing baseball for almost twenty years.
